Vi has different modes of operation. This is crucial to understand:

Normal Mode (Command Mode): This is the default mode when you open vi/Vim. In this mode, keystrokes are interpreted as commands (e.g., dd to delete a line, i to insert). You cannot type text directly in this mode. 
How to enter: Press Esc from any other mode.
Insert Mode: In this mode, you can type and insert text into the file.
How to enter: From Normal Mode, press i, a, o, I, A, O, etc.
How to exit: Press Esc to return to Normal Mode.
Visual Mode (Vim only): Allows you to select text visually, character by character, line by line, or block by block, and then apply commands to the selection.
How to enter: From Normal Mode, press v (character), V (line), or Ctrl+v (block).
How to exit: Press Esc to return to Normal Mode.
Command-Line Mode (Ex Mode): Used for more complex commands, like saving, quitting, search/replace, or executing external commands.
How to enter: From Normal Mode, press : (colon).
How to exit: After executing a command, you return to Normal Mode.

i: Insert text before the cursor.
